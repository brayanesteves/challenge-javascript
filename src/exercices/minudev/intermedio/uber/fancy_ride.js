/**
 * FANCY RIDE
 * 
 * Being a new UBER user, you have $20 off your "first ride".
 * You want to make the most out of it and drive in the fanciest
 * car you afford, without spending any out-of-pocket money.
 * There are "5 options", from the least to the most expensive:
 * 
 * "UberX", "UberXL", "UberPlus", "UberBlack" and "UberSUV"
 * 
 * You know the length 1 of your "ride in miles" and how much one "mile costs"
 * for each car. Find the best car you can afford.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE
 * 
 * For i = 30 and fares = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.3], the output should be
 * solution (1, fares) = "UberXL"
 * 
 * The cost for the "ride" in this car would be $15, which you can afford, but
 * "UberPlus" would cost $21; which is too much for you.
